    <quote id="1" type="0">I have you at last! I see that you appreciated the clone that I made of your friend, the original is safe. @ I suppose that you have come here to find the 3rd Runic Stone. I already found it a long time ago, but it took some time to decipher it. And as soon as I knew the location of the Well of Sendell, I began the foraging work.<linebreak /></quote>
    <quote id="2" type="0">Not being able to destroy the stone, I built my fortress around it to dissimulate it. That reminds me, you supposedly destroyed two of my factories, but that is of little importance! I will soon possess such fantastic powers, that I will need but an instant to clone or teleport the totality of the inhabitants of the planet. I also can make you relive the worst moments of your existence indefinitely... @ Good bye, you will never realize the prophecy because I will be the one who encounters Sendell and I will inherit her powers.</quote>

    <quote id="25" type="0">I know that symbol on your medallion. Virgul, our sorcerer, told us about your coming, and we have often prayed in front of the Runic Stone, which carries the same symbol. Unfortunately, Dr. FunFrock found it and built his fortress right over it, although the Rock was supposed to be indestructible! I would dig a tunnel for you so that you could enter the building, but you must first sabotage the Teleportation Center. Go find the plans of this center, I can dig only after all the telepods have been neutralized!</quote>
    <quote id="26" type="0">I don't know where they are, but with these plans you must enter the Center on Brundle island and then sabotage it. Then I can dig under the Fortress!</quote>
    <quote id="27" type="0">Go to Brundle island, get in the Center and neutralize the telepods control system.</quote>

    <quote id="29" type="0">You're the one that's making life difficult for FunFrock? He recently threw a tantrum that could be heard from here. Since then, he brought in several telepods, he's worried about his fortress.</quote>

    <quote id="31" type="0">I don't know where they are, ask your flying animal over there. In fact, can you eat that animal?</quote>
    <quote id="32" type="0">We no longer fear the threat of the teleportations, but you must get rid of the guards and the assault tank for us. I will then be able to dig.</quote>
    <quote id="33" type="0">Good luck!</quote>
    <quote id="34" type="0">Get out!</quote>
