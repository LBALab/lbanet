<text id="0">What are you doing here? This sector is off limits to the public.</text>
<text id="1">Halt!</text>
<text id="2">Stop squirming, prisoner Twinsen!</text>
<text id="3">Hey, you! You're not one of my nurses! Sound the alarm!</text>
<text id="4">Good day, fellow nurse.</text>
<text id="5">A prisoner has escaped! @ Sound the alarm!</text>
<text id="6">RULE# 1024-GH : @ Dr. FunFrock reminds you that it is absolutely forbidden to make any allusion whatsoever to the so called Legend.</text>
<text id="7">Long live the venerable Dr. FunFrock, the one who saved us from all the superstitions.</text>
<text id="8">Hmmmmm... what if I try to get the guard's attention?</text>
<text id="9">Good day</text>
<text id="10">You've returned at last, my love! Come inside quickly - all the clones must be looking for you.</text>
<text id="11"></text>
<text id="12">Twinsen, where were you? I was worried sick!</text>
<text id="13">I've just escaped from the asylum. They think that I am a trouble maker because of the strange dreams I have, the ones where Sendell is calling me. I spoke to you about them on several occasions.</text>
<text id="14">I rummage around here as there's no one guarding this place. I hide in the truck so that the guards won't see me. You just have to jump into the pile of garbage and be VERY DISCREET about it.</text>
<text id="15">Hi! What are you doing there? Did you know that you can read the posters? All you have to do is move in front of one and use the ACTION command while in normal mode.</text>
<text id="16">Uhhh ... How's it going? </text>
<text id="17">I know where they went and I'll help you if you buy me a drink. Ask the waiter about it.</text>
<text id="18">You're being held here because you are a trouble maker. An informant told us that you claim to have prophetic dreams. @ Calm down, we're going to dissect... uh, I mean... take care of you!</text>
<text id="19"></text>
<text id="20">Ok, I just have to wait for the truck to move into place.</text>
<text id="21">It is forbidden to travel outside the Citadel in that kind of attire!</text>
<text id="22">Twinsen! What are you doing here? I heard you were arrested only yesterday!</text>
<text id="23">They let me out early for good behavior!</text>
<text id="24">Impossible! Nobody gets out of the Citadel alive!</text>
<text id="25">ANNOUNCEMENT #357-G: @ A new automatic surveillance device is now operating in the city. All citizens must remain motionless if one of these devices is in their vicinity.</text>
<text id="26">It is forbidden to use that robot !</text>
<text id="27">You look kind of lost, Mr. Nurse. Use your holomap if you don't know how to get back home!</text>
<text id="28">Welcome aboard! You have picked a wonderful day for travelling, the weather is beautiful!</text>
<text id="29">I think it's time to make use of what you hid in the house.</text>
<text id="30">Open up! We know you're in there!</text>
<text id="31">You are charged with aiding an escapee. Follow us!</text>
<text id="32">I'm looking for a young girl. She is being escorted by two groboclones.</text>
<text id="33">Sound the alarm! It's the escapee!</text>
<text id="34">I believe that you can read all the posters. All you have to do is move in front of one and use the ACTION command while in normal mode. I can't really help you out, because I don't know how to read!</text>
<text id="35">I haven't seen them. @ Sorry!</text>
<text id="36">I saw them at the port a little while ago. They were leaving for another island. It's strange, because prisoners usually stay at the Citadel.</text>
<text id="37">You need a ticket to board the ferry. You can buy one next door.</text>
<text id="38">Good day, one ticket for... Sound the alarm! It's the escapee!</text>
<text id="39">I've had it up to my trunk! There are 4 crates in the warehouse that I cannot seem to arrange on the 4 crosses painted on the ground. I would gladly give a ferry ticket to anyone who could help me out of this mess.</text>
<text id="40">Hey! You over there, come here!</text>
<text id="41"></text>
<text id="42">I can't open this chest with this blasted trick back of mine! Gimme a hand and I'll let you keep some of what's inside. All you have to do is move in front of the chest while in normal mode and use the ACTION command. You can do the same for rummaging through lots of things like cupboards, garbage cans, etc...</text>
<text id="43"></text>
<text id="44"></text>
<text id="45"></text>
<text id="46">My son and I fixed the ventilation flap in your chimney. We'll put up a fence later. It's odd that it is so far away from your house! According to my son, who is an architect, there are a lot of strange things about your house!</text>
<text id="47">You know, don't worry about putting up a fence around the chimney. I've thought about it and I prefer to keep it as it is.</text>
<text id="48">Good day.</text>
<text id="49">Try the tavern, you never know...</text>
<text id="50">The crates are arranged correctly this time. Thank you, and please accept this ferry ticket as a token of my gratitude.</text>
<text id="51">I'm on special assignment for the good Dr. FunFrock, and am looking for the plans of the Teleportation Center.</text>
<text id="52">Come in friend! We will look at them together because they are rather complicated.</text>
<text id="53">I was put in charge of verifying this building because it was built over ruins that are marked with a strange symbol. It seems that a mad man is attacking different sites also marked with this same symbol. All this extra work has really ruined my weekend! @ We're really worried about the Teleportation Center: it's weak point is situated on the left, right after the first guard post.</text>
<text id="54">You will need my card to get into the center. It is on the drawing table. If you do succeed in catching this vandal with his weird Horn, I would appreciate it if you would kick his rear end for me!</text>
<text id="55">Go ask my son, he has come home from work. Sorry about your house: the clones came with an attack tank, and they were looking for you!</text>
<text id="56">I would like to buy a drink for the grobo upstairs.</text>
<text id="57">Very good sir, but that will cost you 10 Kashes per drink.</text>
<text id="58">Hide! They have itchy trigger fingers!</text>
<text id="59">Keep the planet clean!</text>
<text id="60">Let's see now, where did I put my key?</text>
<text id="61">Dad! Do you have a key with you?</text>
<text id="62">All you have to do is ask.</text>
<text id="63">I've got to get into the Teleportation Center.</text>
<text id="64">You don't have to be aggressive all the time. I don't talk to pushy people!</text>
<text id="65">10 Kashes! That's too expensive!</text>
<text id="66">You've just got back all the objects that were in your inventory!</text>
<text id="67">Don't ever try teleporting yourself - it's very dangerous! Only the clones can do it.</text>
<text id="68">Welcome to Lupin-Burg @ (Citadel Island).</text>
<text id="69">Yeah, the clones already confiscated the key to my cellar, so don't be surprised when they come back to close down the tavern!</text>
<text id="70">Welcome to Citadel Island</text>
<text id="71">We are going to close this tavern down. Get out of here!</text>
<text id="72">Good day, this talk about the Legend is strange, don't you think?</text>
<text id="73"></text>
<text id="74">The 4 crates are not on the 4 crosses, try again!</text>
<text id="75">I don't know anything about it, and it is forbidden to talk about it!</text>
<text id="76">I saw them! They left for another island, but I don't know which one.</text>
<text id="77">It is forbidden to talk about it! </text>
<text id="78">Bah! That doesn't interest me. Go see at the library or go drown your sorrows at the tavern; or even better, do it the other way around.</text>
<text id="79">What's strange is that you're talking about it. That's forbidden, you know!</text>
<text id="80">I don't know. The books that mention it have been confiscated and sent to Principal Island.</text>
<text id="81">It is forbidden to talk about that!</text>
<text id="82">Prisoner Twinsen, I've already had enough of seeing you here, so don't make any more problems for yourself!</text>
<text id="83">A piece of advice: surrender instead of trying to provoke us.</text>
<text id="84">You are not going to get away by evoking that subversive propaganda.</text>
<text id="85">I'm a bartender, you know, so I've have had my fill of bar jokes and strange stories!</text>
<text id="86">I don't know anything about it, but the tavern will soon be closed down. That's been confirmed!</text>
<text id="87">Good day</text>
<text id="88">Well, I don't know anything about it. But you could offer me a drink anyway?</text>
<text id="89">This room contains information and weapons that were amassed for generations to help the Heir who will, one day, be chosen from our descendants. The key to the room was passed down from generation to generation, but our ancestor Hégésippe was the last family member to retain the key. He was attacked and killed by the ruthless pirate LeBorgne during a sea voyage. Nobody knows where Leborgne's treasure, which undoubtedly contains the golden key to the room, is today." </text>
<text id="90">You who read this text, know that there are 3 Runic Stones in this world. Their locations are now indicated on your Holomap. They are large menhirs with runic text written on them. They will help the Heir in his quest for Sendell. The third stone will show the exact location of the Well of Sendell. In addition to the help provided by the text, each stone conceals a secret.</text>
<text id="91">Bug street @ (Citadel Island).</text>
<text id="92">It's ok, let's go!</text>
<text id="93">You don't have enough Kashes, come back later!</text>
<text id="94">Good day</text>
<text id="95">Life candy: do you want 10 hearts for 10 Kashes?</text>
<text id="96">Ok, I'll take them.</text>
<text id="97">No, thank you.</text>
<text id="98">Not enough Kashes!</text>
<text id="99">Good day, I would like some information about LeBorgne the pirate.</text>
<text id="100">L.B.A. @ Lupin-Burg sewer service @ Little Vachond street</text>
<text id="101">L.B.A. @ Lupin-Burg sewer service @ Dr FunFrock Square</text>
<text id="102">Halt!</text>
<text id="103">Hey, you! You're not one of my nurses! Sound the alarm!</text>
<text id="104">Good day, fellow nurse.</text>
<text id="105">Good day, fellow nurse.</text>
<text id="106">A prisoner is escaping! @ Sound the alarm!</text>
<text id="107">A prisoner is escaping! @ Sound the alarm!</text>
<text id="108">A prisoner is escaping! @ Sound the alarm!</text>
<text id="109">Good day, neighbor.</text>
<text id="110">Good day, neighbor.</text>
<text id="111">Good day</text>
<text id="112">Good day</text>
<text id="113">Good day</text>
<text id="114">Hey buddy!</text>
<text id="115">Good day</text>
<text id="116">Good day</text>
<text id="117">You are being held here because you are a trouble maker.</text>
<text id="118">Hey, Mr. Nurse! Use your holomap if you're lost.</text>
<text id="119">You know, the holomap is activated by the "H" key. And you'd better try to get it back or buy another one at the bazaar on Principal Island.</text>
<text id="120">I haven't seen them. @ @ Sorry!</text>
<text id="121">I'd like to help you, but I haven't seen them.</text>
<text id="122">I haven't seen them. @ @ Sorry!</text>
<text id="123">Didn't see 'em. I ain't budged an inch!</text>
<text id="124">I didn't see them. Try at the tavern, you never know...</text>
<text id="125">I haven't seen anyone, but ask inside the tavern.</text>
<text id="126">You need a ticket to board the ferry. You can buy one next door. </text>
<text id="127">Leave me alone, I have nothing to say to you.</text>
<text id="128">Try the tavern, you never know.</text>
<text id="129">Try the tavern, that sounds like something they would be familiar with.</text>
<text id="130">Don't get all excited, son! I prefer talking calmly.</text>
<text id="131">Calm down quickly! If you are going to be like that, I won't speak to you any more.</text>
<text id="132">Did you know that the telepods are dangerous for all species? Only the clones can use them!</text>
<text id="133">A piece of advice: surrender instead of provoking us.</text>
<text id="134">Quiet!</text>
<text id="135">Thanks, mate!</text>
<text id="136">I was trying to dig a tunnel, but the noise tipped them off!</text>
<text id="137">Where do you want to go?</text>
<text id="138">To Principal Island</text>
<text id="139">To the White Leaf Desert</text>
<text id="140">To Proxima Island</text>
<text id="141">To Rebellion Island</text>
<text id="142">I'm staying here!</text>
<text id="143">Bah! That doesn't interest me.</text>
<text id="144">Hi!</text>
<text id="145">Sorry, I haven't seen her!</text>
<text id="146">I don't know what those things are!</text>
<text id="147">Yes... Hey, stop talking about it, ok? That's a sure way to wind up in the Citadel.</text>
<text id="148"></text>
<text id="149">I don't know what that is all about.</text>
<text id="150">I know that LeBorgne had some kind of a captain's log written for him (he was practically illiterate), and the boss of the tavern on Principal Island knows where it is!</text>
<text id="151">They took a fast boat a little while ago. Destination unknown.</text>
<text id="152">One day, one of my swabs claimed that LeBorgne was an ancestor of mine and... well, you know how dramatic burials at sea can be!</text>
<text id="153">I can't help you out, my friend. Don't know what you're talking about.</text>
<text id="154">That's none of your business!</text>
<text id="155">Ask the sailor, he would have know who LeBorgne was.</text>
<text id="156">Not me!</text>
<text id="157">Bah, you think so? And in the first place, I don't know it.</text>
<text id="158">Asks one of my colleagues working in the warehouse on the port. He will know about this LeBorgne.</text>
<text id="159">There is a library on Principal Island, but I don't know if they have any books about the Legend there.</text>
<text id="160">I don't know anything about that story.</text>
<text id="161">Sorry, but I don't know what that could be about.</text>
<text id="162">Don't know him!</text>
<text id="163">I was not informed about this mission!</text>
<text id="164">Really! Well that's too bad, but I don't know anything about it.</text>
<text id="165">I've never seen those plans.</text>
<text id="166">What legend? I don't know about any legend!</text>
<text id="167">Good day</text>
<text id="168">Ask a sailor that type of question.</text>
<text id="169">Sorry, I don't know where they are.</text>
<text id="170">Bah! That holds little interest for me.</text>
<text id="171">That's in the past now, there are no pirates living today.</text>
<text id="172">Sorry, but I don't know what that could be about.</text>
<text id="173">I didn't see them, but try asking at the tavern.</text>
<text id="174">Never heard anything about it!</text>
<text id="175">I'm looking for the plans of the Teleportation Center - I'm on a special assignment!</text>
<text id="176">I haven't seen them. @ @ Sorry!</text>
<text id="177">Sorry neighbor, I don't know what you're talking about.</text>
<text id="178">Try over at the port, all the sailors knew that pirate.</text>
<text id="179">Good day, I'm looking for a friend. She is escorted by two groboclones.</text>
<text id="180">I didn't see her, but if she was arrested, where she is, surely isn't any of your business!</text>
<text id="181">I don't know what you are talking about.</text>
<text id="182">Can I see your ferry ticket please?</text>
<text id="183"></text>
<text id="184">Ask a sailor, he might be able to help you.</text>
<text id="185">I don't know where they are.</text>
<text id="186">I haven't seen them.</text>
<text id="187">If you still want to take the ferry, I can sell you some tickets for only 5 kashes each. I print them up myself.</text>
<text id="188">You don't have enough Kashes, come back later.</text>
<text id="189">No more gas.</text>
<text id="190">Sorry, but someone came by for the robot. Apparently, they needed it at a top secret construction site.</text>
<text id="191">Ok I will take care of it.</text>
<text id="192">The job is done!</text>
<text id="193">Ok, then go and come back to me when you are finished.</text>
<text id="194">Good bye!</text>
<text id="195">Lets talk about something else...</text>
<text id="196">Show me your wares.</text>
<text id="197">Thanks again for the help! What can I do for you?</text>
<text id="198">So how is it going with my the crates?</text>
</texts>
